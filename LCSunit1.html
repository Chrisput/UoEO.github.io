												<h3>Reflections</h3>
												<p>Below are my key learnings and reflections</p>
												<ul>
													<li>While I was familiar with the GDPR regulation, I learned that there are professional organisations that publish principles and practices to be followed by computer professionals. In particular these are the BCS Code of Conduct from the Chartered Institute for IT and the Code of Ethics from IEEE.</li>
													<li>The skills set required by computer science professionals goes much beyond technical skills. Critical thinking is a key skill to formulate solutions as well as the ability to think ouside of the box. Probably one of the most important characteristics for a computer professional is ethical behaviour.</li> 
													<li>Cybersecurity protects computers, networks, and data from cybercrime. The most common forms of attack are malware and Denial of Service, common protection is through firewall, proxy server, and auditing and antivirus software. Cryptography is used to send and receive messages securily.</li>
													<li>Advance in AI is seen by some as freeing humans from boring, mundane tasks, by others it is seen as curse that robs jobs from humans and channels wealth towards those with power. While computers can do a lot of things faster and better than human, the right ethical question is 'what tasks ought to be given to computers'</li> 
												</ul>
