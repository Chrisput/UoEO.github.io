												<h3>Reflections</h3>
												<p>Below are my key learnings and reflections</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Due to more computers and devices being connected to the internet and to network connections, cybercrime is on the rise. It was interesting to learn about public-key encryption in the field of Cryptography. It involves 2 keys, one as a public key and one as a private key. To avoid imposters providing a public key there are certificate authorities who issue certificates to clients.</li>												<li>I tested Google Translate to translate from Dutch to English, the translation is impecable. I learned that Google uses an artificial neural network to increase fluency and accuracy. The program generates translations using patterns found in huge amounts of text, discovered through millions of documents that have already been translated by humans. As time goes on, the program recognizes more and more patterns, receives input from real people, and continues to refine its translations.</li>
													<li>I learned from Google AI about the human choices in shaping a machine learning system. This is a simple model to develop an agent that maximises winning at the Tic-tac-toe game. I learned the steps on how to train a model, how to test the quality of training, and how to improve the learning.</li> 
													<li>I continued to practice the HTML syntax to further enhance my e-Portfolio</li>
													<li>I learned about Codio and how to use the Codio Editor</li> 
												</ul>
