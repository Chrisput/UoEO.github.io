												<h3>Reflections</h3>
												<p>Below are my key learnings and reflections</p>
												<ul>
													<li>A computer network refers to numerous computers and other devices connected, either locally or remotely, to support the transfer of data from on to another. These computers can be connected in a peer-to-peer organisation or may be in a client-server topology.</li>
													<li>The topology selected depends on size, cost, speed and distance they cover. A Local Area Network (LAN) connects through Intranet. A Wide Area Network (WAN) connects larger networks and build and Internet.</li> 
													<li>These network are grouped and segmented by various other devices, i.e. switches, repeaters, bridges, and routers. Access to the networks can be achieved using protocols, namely Internet Protocols (IP). there are other protocols for specific tasks such as Simple File Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (PO), and File Tranfer Protocols (FTP).</li>
													<li>Accessing information through these networks requires the world wide web (wwww) where a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is assigned to each website and they can be accessed by a protocal called Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Each webpage is formatted, and information is represented using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). To locate, display and navigate around webpages we need a browser.</li>
													<li>Big data can no longer be processed by traditional database techniques. Hadoop is a leading software technology for big data, it allows for distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using a simple programming model. It delivers high availability on top of a cluster of computers. Two key components: Hadoop Distributed File System for Storage and MapReduce for Data processing.</li>
													<li>UNIX command line syntax, aka Bash: Introduction, File System Commancs, The File System.</li>
